- 👋 Hi, I’m @WGriffin23
- 👀 I’m primarily interested in Statistics and Deep Learning. I have experience with Python, including NumPy, Pandas, and PyTorch
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my MS in Computer Science from The University of Chicago
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting projects in Python. Many of the projects I have completed for school are private due to Academic Integrity policies, but can be viewed by outside parties upon special request by myself as needed. 
- 📫 How to reach me: WGriffin23@UChicago.edu
