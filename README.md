- 👋 Hi, I’m @WGriffin23
- 👀 I’m interested in building my coding skills from the ground up. I have experience with Python and beginner level C. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mathematics, statistics and economics at UChicago
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting projects in Python. Eventually I'd like to expand to other languages. Many of the projects I have completed for school are private due to Academic Integrity policies, but can be viewed by outside parties upon special request by myself as needed. 
- 📫 How to reach me: WGriffin23@UChicago.edu
